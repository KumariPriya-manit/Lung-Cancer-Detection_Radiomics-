# Lung-Cancer-Detection_Radiomics-
## Project Overview
The goal of the project is to predict the type of cancer a person has based on images of a person's lungs. Although there are different types of cancer stages, the clincal T stage was the only one considered. Clinical T stage values range from 1 to 5 and the accuracy of the training of the network is outputted.
## Steps
* Import data set
* Retrieve data from the first patient as a test
* Define a function to work with Hounsfield units (HU)
* Define a function to resample the image
* Define a function to plot the 3D images
* Visualize segmented lungs
* Save preprocessed data to a separate script
* Convolution
## Skills Used

* Software:
  * Python
  * Google Cloud
  * Tensorflow
  * Numpy
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * Anaconda
  * Keras
  
* Knowledge Acquired: 
  * Formulating tasks as machine learning problems.
  * Loading, pre-processing, and extracting features from common data sources.
  * Mathematically describing simple models of the data.
  * Fitting the models to the data and using models for prediction and estimation.
  * Evaluating goodness of fit and refining models.
  * Evaluating the performance of methods using statistical techniques.
